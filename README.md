### 2. Project
Contains my final course project: **"Mapping Mortality in Chile: Visualising Regional Health Inequalities"**

This project analyzes mortality patterns across Chilean regions (2002-2022) using individual death records from DEIS and population data from INE. It features interactive visualisations exploring temporal trends and regional disparities in causes of death.
