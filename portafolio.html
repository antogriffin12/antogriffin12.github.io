            <h2>Section 1: Adding two graphs using vegaEmbed function</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                In this section I add two charts using the vegaEmbed function. Both graphs are from RDeconomist.github.io.
                The first graph shows projected cumulative population changes from 2020 to 2100, with several countries, especially South Korea, Japan, Italy, Spain and France experiencing significant long-term declines. 
                In contrast, the United States and the United Kingdom are expected to maintain moderate population growth over the century.

            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                The second graph shows how different categories contribute to the UK CPIH consumer basket over time, with Housing & Utilities consistently making up the largest share at around 30%. Other categories such as Food, Transport, and Recreation fluctuate moderately, while items like Education, Hotels, and Communication remain relatively small and stable components of overall household spending.

            <h2>Section 2: Creating my own visualisations</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                In this section I created two separate charts using the “create” tool in Economics Observatory Data Hub.
            <p>
                The first chart shows Japan's unemployment rate from 1992 to 2023, revealing a significant rise during the early 2000s when unemployment peaked at around 5.5%, followed by a gradual decline to approximately 2.5% by 2020. 
                This trend reflects Japan's economic recovery after the "Lost Decade" and its relatively stable labor market in recent years.

        </div>
        <figure id="Location3"></figure> <!-- we give it an id so we can put a vega-lite graph here with VegaEmbed -->
            <p>
                The second chart displays the UK employment rate for people aged 16 and over from 1971 to 2023, showing a general upward trend from around 55% to over 60%. The data reveals periods of decline during economic recessions, particularly in the early 1980s and 1990s, but demonstrates overall improvement in labor market participation over the past five decades, with employment rates reaching historically high levels in recent years before the pandemic.
