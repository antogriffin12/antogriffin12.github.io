        <div class="project-text">
            <p>
                This project examines regional health inequalities in Chile through seven interactive visualisations 
                covering 2002 to 2022. I quantify geographic disparities, identify their demographic and structural 
                drivers, and assess whether gaps are narrowing or widening. Beyond crude mortality rates, I explore 
                age at death to identify regional blue zones and demonstrate automated API-driven data collection to 
                predict life expectancy.

            <h2>1. Regional mortality landscape</h2>
            <p>
                Chile's south-central regions experienced 8-9 deaths per 1,000 by 2022, compared with around 5 in 
                northern regions such as Tarapacá and Antofagasta. This 40% gap remains stable over two decades. 
                COVID hit southern areas hardest, highlighting vulnerabilities in regions with older populations 
                and weaker health infrastructure.

            <h2>2. The gap is widening</h2>
            <p>
                The mortality gap remained around 2.0 deaths per 1,000 from 2002 to 2011. This period coincided with 
                Chile's 2005 GES (Explicit Health Guarantees) reform, which provided legally binding healthcare rights 
                for priority conditions. Although GES improved treatment access, it did not reduce regional disparities. 
                Since 2012, the gap has widened, and COVID-19 significantly accelerated this trend, doubling inequalities 
                to nearly 4.0 deaths per 1,000 by 2022, the highest in twenty years.

            <h2>3. What are the leading causes of death?</h2>
            <p>
                Circulatory diseases and cancer drive most deaths in Chile, reflecting the epidemiological shift 
                to chronic illnesses, typical in ageing populations. COVID became the third-leading cause in 2020-2021. 
                Regional differences are notable: metropolitan zones have higher cancer mortality, while southern regions 
                face more respiratory deaths even before COVID. These patterns highlight the need for region-specific 
                health policies.

            <h2>4. The COVID-19 shock</h2>
            <p>
                To assess COVID's impact on mortality, I built a linear regression model using 26 years of pre-pandemic 
                data (1994-2019). The model (R² = 0.960) shows a steady increase of about 1,364 deaths annually as 
                Chile's population ages. Based on this trend, Chile would have had roughly 109,000 deaths in 2020 
                (126,100 died), and 110,400 in 2021 (137,600 died), with excess mortality totalling 69,600 over three 
                years (21% increase).

            <h2>5. Age structure as a determinant of mortality</h2>
            <p>
                The Swaroop Index measures the percentage of deaths among people aged 50+ (proxy for population ageing). 
                In Chile, it ranges from 85% in Tarapacá to 92% in Ñuble, as northern mining regions attract younger 
                people, while southern agricultural areas have aged as youth migrate to cities. <br>
                A scatter plot shows a positive correlation between demographic composition and mortality rates, 
                but only explains 45% of the variation (r² = 0.45). Demographics influence outcomes but do not solely 
                determine them.

            <p>
                Mean age at death varies by 6.2 years across Chilean regions, with Valparaíso at 74.5 years, 
                known as a blue zone for long-lived populations, and Tarapacá at 68.3 years. Valparaíso has high 
                crude mortality but an older population, while Tarapacá has the opposite. Coastal regions like 
                Valparaíso and Coquimbo consistently have the highest longevity, indicating factors beyond healthcare, 
                such as geography, climate, or lifestyle, influence lifespan. <br>

            <h2>7. Predicting life expectancy</h2>
            <p>
                Chile's life expectancy rose from 77 to over 80 years between 2000 and 2019. While a predictive model 
                trained on this pre-pandemic period (R² = 0.916, RMSE = 0.28 years) demonstrates a strong fit, the 
                visualisation reveals a break in 2020. The red dashed prediction line continues upward, and actual 
                life expectancy drops sharply and remains depressed through 2022. This gap quantifies COVID's demographic 
                toll, showing how a single external shock can reverse decades of health progress. The contrast between 
                predicted and actual trajectories illustrates the value of baseline models for measuring crisis impacts.

    <section>
        <h2>Data, Tools and Analytical Challenges</h2>
        <div class="project-text">
            <p>
                The dataset includes 2.65 million mortality records from DEIS (1990-2022) processed in Python with 
                pandas, combined with INE population estimates to calculate regional mortality rates. Life expectancy 
                and socioeconomic indicators were retrieved via the World Bank API. <br>
                The main technical challenge was processing millions of records. Initial attempts without low_memory=False caused type inference errors. 
                After fixing this, I used ICD-10 to classify causes into 13 categories, including COVID-19 (U07.1, U07.2). Standardising geographic names 
                across DEIS, INE, and GeoJSON formats was also challenging, especially for Magallanes. <br>
                All visualisations use Vega-Lite with time sliders, regression transforms, conditional encoding, 
                and interactivity. The full workflow is reproducible via linked GitHub and Colab resources.

    <!-- CONCLUSIONS -->
    <section>
        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <div class="project-text">
            <p>
                Chile's regional health inequalities are significant, with southern regions experiencing nearly 
                double the mortality rates of northern areas. Yet longevity patterns reveal important nuance: 
                Valparaíso achieves the highest age at death (74.5 years) while Tarapacá, despite lower mortality, 
                shows earlier deaths (68.3 years). This difference between crude rates and actual longevity demonstrates 
                that high mortality can reflect an aged population rather than poor health outcomes. <br>
                However, demographic ageing explains 45% of regional variation in mortality, indicating that healthcare 
                quality and socioeconomic disparities are policy-meaningful issues. COVID exposed these structural 
                weaknesses, with 69,600 excess deaths falling disproportionately on regions. Chile needs differentiated 
                regional strategies: southern regions require systems optimised for ageing populations with chronic 
                diseases, while northern areas need services tailored to younger working populations. The widening gap 
                documented here should serve as a wake-up call for policymakers.
